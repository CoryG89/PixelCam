PixelCam
========

Webcam with pixelation applied on each frame giving the video censored type of
look. PixelCam currently uses [**`desandro/close-pixelate`**][close-pixelate]
modified to accept a canvas element as input directly instead of only an image
element. For easy access to the webcam data I use a library I wrote particularly
for that purpose, [**`CoryG89/CamMan.js`**][camman-js].

Check out a pixelated you on the [**live demo**][demo]!
